Testing streaming processing

## Objective
I want to deploy this small stream on GCP.
What we need for that is 
- Docker
- Kafka
- Terraform for provisioning
- Producer App
- Github actions ?
- K8 ?

Need to figure out how all of this will work in tandem, will we need different machines for kafka cluster, producer and consumer or would one work. Use case is simple but the idea is to learn how to build real world complicated apps.
